            <p>A number of quantum processors consisting of a few tens of noisy qubits already exist, 
              and are called Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. 
              Their low number of qubits precludes the use of quantum error correction procedures, 
              and then only small-size quantum algorithms can be successfully run. 
              These quantum algorithms need to be compiled to respect the constraints imposed by 
              the quantum processor, known as the mapping or routing problem. 
              The mapping will result in an increase of the number of gates and circuit depth, 
              decreasing the algorithm's success rate. In this paper, we present a mapper called 
              Qmap that makes quantum circuits executable on the Surface-17 processor, 
              a scalable processor with a surface code architecture. It takes into account 
              not only the elementary gate set and qubit connectivity constraints but also 
              the restrictions imposed by the use of shared classical control, 
              which have not been considered so far. Qmap is embedded in the OpenQL compiler and 
              uses a configuration file where the processor's characteristics are described and 
              that makes it capable of targeting different quantum processors. 
              To show this flexibility and evaluate its performance, we map 56 quantum benchmarks 
              on two different superconducting quantum processors, the Surface-17 (17 qubits) and 
              the IBM Q Tokyo (20 qubits), while using different routing strategies. 
              We show that the best router can reduce the resulting overhead up to 80% (72%) 
              for the number of gates and up to 71.4% (66.7%) for the circuit latency (depth) on 
              the Surface-17 (IBM Q Tokyo) when compared to the baseline (trivial router). 
              In addition, having a slightly higher qubit connectivity helps to decrease 
              the number of inserted movement operations (up to 82.3%). 
              Finally, we analyze how the mapping affects the reliability of some small quantum 
              circuits. Their fidelity shows a decrease that ranges from 1.8% to 13.8%.

              <p>We present voqc, the first verified compiler for quantum circuits, written using the Coq proof assistant.
                Quantum circuits are expressed as programs in a simple, low-level language called sqir, which is deeply
                embedded in Coq. Optimizations and other transformations are expressed as Coq functions, which are proved
                correct with respect to a semantics of sqir programs. sqir is also sufficiently expressive write source programs
                and prove them correct. We evaluate voqc’s verified optimizations on a series of benchmarks, and it performs
                comparably to industrial strength compilers. voqc’s optimizations reduce total gate counts on average by 8.4%
                (and rotation gates on average by 16.1%) on a benchmark of 29 circuit programs compared to a 4.7% reduction
                (resp, a 8.3% reduction) when using IBM’s Qiskit compiler at optimization level 2.

              <p>In this paper, we present CertiQ, a mostly-automated verification framework for the Qiskit quantum compiler. To our knowledge, CertiQ is the first effort to apply formal verification and SMT reasoning to a real-world quantum compiler. Qiskit is currently the most complete and widely-used open-source quantum software stack from low-level compilation to high-level quantum algorithms. With growing community contributions, the Qiskit compiler is in need of code quality control and verification down to the compilation level to guarantee reliability of scientific work that uses it. CertiQ is deeply integrated into the Qiskit compiler (called Terra), providing abstract specifications for quantum compiler data structures and offering verifiable contracts that specify the behaviors of compilation phases with heavy optimizations. CertiQ enables verification of the existing implementation of the Qiskit compiler and future code submissions in a mostly-automated manner using invariant-guided contracts and contract continuation. With these techniques in place, developers need to provide limited inputs only where function contracts and loop invariant cannot be inferred automatically. The CertiQ verification procedure discovers several critical bugs, some of which are unique to quantum soft-ware. Our extensive case studies on four compiler phases of Qiskit demonstrate that CertiQ is effective for verification of quantum compilers with a low proof burden.</p>
